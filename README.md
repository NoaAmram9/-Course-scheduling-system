# Course Scheduling System

A course scheduling system designed to help students build efficient and personalized semester schedules.

## 🚀 Getting Started

This project is written in **Python** and provides a graphical user interface  using **PyQt5** for selecting courses, setting time constraints, and generating valid schedules.

To run the system, open the `App.py` file and run it (e.g., press `F5` in your IDE).

## 🧭 Project Structure

- `App.py` – Entry point for running the application.
- `SRC/` – Source code folder containing:
  - `Controller/` – Application logic controllers.
  - `ViewLayer/` – GUI components built with PyQt5.
  - `Models/` – Data structures such as Course, Lesson, etc.
  - `Services/` – Handles file I/O, validation, scheduling, prefrences and time constraints.
  - `tests/` – tests for logic and GUI.


## 🔀 Branches

- `Part 3` – Including performance optimization, user experience improvements, and dynamic scheduling features.

## 📥 Installation

Make sure you have Python installed.

Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install pandas openpyxl PyQt5 pytest xlrd
```
